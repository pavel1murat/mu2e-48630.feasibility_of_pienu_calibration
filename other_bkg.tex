\begin{itemize}
\item
  $\pi^+ \to \mu^+ \nu \to e^+ \nu \nu $ in the ST
  energy conservation : extends up to the $\pi^+ \to e^+ \nu$ peak, but not higher
  
  large BR, suppressed by the muon lifetime, phase space
  
\item
  $\pi^+ \to \mu^+ \nu \to e^+ \nu \nu $ in the degrader. The same argumens
\item
  decays of stopped $\mu^+$ : nominally end at 52.8
\end{itemize}
