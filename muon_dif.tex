\section {Muon decays in flight and the degrader thickness}

{\red Briefly Describe the multistage simulation - standard Mu2e scheme
  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    first: simulation of muon beam till the DS
  \item
    then - resampling in the DS, simulaiton of the muon decays in flight
  \item
    Krzysztof's scheme - constant weight factor, but a change in the Z distributions
    of the muon decay vertices
  \end{itemize}
