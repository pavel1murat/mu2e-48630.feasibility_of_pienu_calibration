\section {Muon decays in flight and the degrader thickness}

{\red Briefly Describe the multistage simulation - standard Mu2e scheme
  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    first: simulation of muon beam till the DS
  \item
    then - resampling in the DS, simulation of the muon decays in flight
  \item
    Krzysztof's scheme - constant weight factor, but a change in the Z distributions
    of the muon decay vertices
  \end{itemize}

The scale factor coming out of the simulation is $SF = 15.0 \pm 1$ , consistent with the back-of-the-envelope
estimate of
$$
            SF = 1/(1 - exp^{-T_{max}/\tau}) = 15.15 ~~,
$$
where $T_{max} = 150$ ns and $\tau = 2197$ ns, the muon lifetime at rest. The [assigned] uncertainty also covers
the  range of the DF variations as a function of the decay vertex Z coordinate.
Therefore constraining the muon proper decay time in the detector to 150 ns improves the simulation efficiency
by a factor of 15 w/o introducing extra event-dependent weights.
