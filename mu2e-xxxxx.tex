  \begin{abstract}
    \vspace{0.2in}
    A possibility of using the \piplusenu\ decays of positive pions stopped
    in the stopping target (ST) for the Mu2e momentum scale calibration has been long
    discussed within the collaboration. The calibration relies on reconstruction 
    of the \piplusenu\ peak and its success critically depends on  suppression of
    the $\mu^+ \to e^+ \nu_e \bar{\nu_{\mu}} $ decays in flight (DIF). 

    The analysis presented in this note is based on the simulated DIF statistics
    of $\sim 8 \times 10^{12}$ protons on target (POT). It establishes the event selection
    procedure which drastically reduces the DIF background and indicates
    that a signal to background (S/B) ratio sufficient for the \piplusenu\ peak
    reconstruction can be achieved. However, drawing a conclusion requires increasing
    the simulated DIF statistics by another order of magnitude, to the level above $10^{14}$ POT.

\section {Introduction}

Feasibility of using \piplusenu\ channel for calibrating the Mu2 momentum scale has been investigated
by several groups - see \cite{MU2E_5391_PIPLUSENU, MU2E_48165_PIPLUSENU} and references therein.
%
The conclusion of the performed studies remains somewhat uncertain. Several issues
are however understood:
\begin{itemize}
\item 
  reconstruction of a peak in the momentum distribution of positrons from \piplusenu\ decays
  requires performing the measurement at early times, T $\sim 300$ ns.
  That requires running at a reduced proton beam beam intensity and allows not to worry
  too much about the pileup.
\item
  to reduce the background from muon decays in flight, this calibration requires 
  special instrumentation, a beam degrader, to be installed in the DS.
\end{itemize}
