\section {Introduction}

Feasibility of using $\pi^+ \to e^+\nu$ for calibrating the momentum scale of the Mu2e tracker
has been investigated by several groups -see \cite{UB_NOTES, PURDUE_NOTES} and references therein.

Presently, the ultimate conclusion remains somewhat uncertain.
Several issues , however, are understood:
\begin{itemize}
\item 
  study of the $\pi^+ \to e^+\nu$ channel requires performing the measurement at early times.
  That requires sigreducing the proton beam proton beam intensity to be significantly reduced. 
  That allows not to worry too much about the pileup
\item
  to reduce the background from muon decays in flight, this calibration requires
  special instrumentation, a beam degrader, to be installed in the DS.
\end{itemize}
