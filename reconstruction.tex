\subsection{Removing muon decays in the tracker}

One of the most dangerous topologies comes from the muon decays in flight backwards in the tracker,
so a positron is produced upstream with small pZ.

In case the pattern recognition uses hits in every second station, the positrons can be misreconstructed
as particles with higher momentum.

In this case the number of hits in the time cluster is expected to be significantly higher
than the number of hits reconstructed on the track.

For degrader thickness of 4mm, a visual scan of DIF events above 65 MeV/c surviving
the tight selection cuts has been performed.

All surviving events represent an irreducible background and can't be rejected.
