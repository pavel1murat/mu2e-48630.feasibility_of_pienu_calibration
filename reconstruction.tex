\section {Reconstruction }

Distributions of the reconstructed track momentum and T0 for all reconstructed positive
tracks from $\pi^+ \to e^+ \nu $ decays in the ST are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:all_tracks_p_t0}.
The distributions corresponding to different degrader thicknesses are overlaid.
One can see that the probability per POT to have a reconstructed positron track reaches its maximum
for degrader thicknesses of about 2-3 mm Ti, and it starts falling down as the degrader thickness
increases.

Compared to ``no degrader'', a 2-3mm thick Ti degrader increases the acceptance by a factor
close to x3.

\subsection{Track selection cuts}

Based on the distributions in the track ID variables presented in Figure~\ref{fig:tid_variables_2mm},
we adopt the track ID cuts shown in the Table~\ref{table:track_id_cuts}

The cut values are very close to an old set of cuts known as "Set C" and used by previous
analyses, expect similat efficiencies.

Cuts on $\tan \lambda$ and the track $d0$ provide significant rejection of the DIF
and $\pi \to e \nu$ decays in the degrader.

  \end{tabularx}

\end{table}

It is worth noticing that the cut on the track dip angle significantly reduces
the contribution of positrons coming from $\pi^+ \to e^+ \nu$ decays in the degrader.

\subsection{Decays of pions stopped in the degrader}

Reconstructed momentum distributions for positrons from $\pi^+ \to e^+ \nu$ decays

For the signal window $67.5 < P < 70$ MeV/c, the relative contribution of pion
decays in degrader is in the range of 10-15\%.

Timing distributions are shown if Figure~\ref{figure:stt_vs_deg_t0_good_tracks}.
As, on average, slower pions stop in the degrader, the degrader timing distributions
fall a little bit slower.
Therefore, at large T0 the contribution of the degrader stops increases.

\subsection{Removing muon decays in the tracker}
{\red doesn't do much, may not need to dicsuss} 

One of the most dangerous topologies comes from the muon decays in flight backwards in the tracker,
so a positron is produced upstream with small pZ.

In case the pattern recognition uses hits in every second station, the positrons can be misreconstructed
as particles with higher momentum.

In this case the number of hits in the time cluster is expected to be significantly higher
than the number of hits reconstructed on the track.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Standard selection - results}

Without the degrader looks quite hopeless:

Distributions for different degrader thicknesses after T0>300 ns cut:

  \caption{

  }
\end{figure}

The plots do not indicate that increasing the degrader thickness from 2mm to 5mm 
improves  the signal to background ratio (S/B) in any significant way - the available
statistics is not sufficient for drawing a conclusion.

For degrader thickness of 4mm, a visual scan of DIF events above 65 MeV/c surviving
the tight selection cuts has been performed.

The surviving events are dominated by the correctly reconstructed events,
the high-momentum tail of the positrons from $\mu^+$ decays-in flight,
not by mis-reconstructed events.
