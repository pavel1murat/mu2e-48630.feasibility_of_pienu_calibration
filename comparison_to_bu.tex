\section{Comparison to BU analysis}

\begin{itemize}
\item 
  Signal yield w/o the degrader: 2.4e-12 BU (2.9 - without the momentum cuts).
  Present analysis 1.8e-12 (67.5-70 MeV/c), 30\% lower
\item
  BU number with the 3.5 mm Be degrader : (after all cuts - mu2e-5391 ,
  what are they?): $2.3 \times 10^{-12}$ / POT 
  The ratio of densities is $\sim$ 2.5 (4.5 vs 1.8 g/cm3),
  so a 3.5 Be degrader, in the 1st approximation is equivalent to a 1.4 mm Ti degrader
\item
  w/o the degrader, the background is about x10 lower:
  at 69 MeV/c it is 2e-12 per POT per 0.5 MeV for BU analysis
  and 2.4e-11 per POT per 0.5 MeV fro this analysis
\item
  Change in the MC? - the fraction of muons arriving to the DS entrance after 200 ns
  is 3\% for the BU analysis and about 30\% for this analysis
\end{itemize}
